# Terrain-Recognition-using-Vision-Transformer
This project explores using a custom-built Vision Transformer (ViT) for terrain recognition. ViT's image analysis strengths are leveraged for efficient and precise terrain classification from imagery data. Python Flask enables local deployment with a web interface built using HTML, CSS, and JS.
